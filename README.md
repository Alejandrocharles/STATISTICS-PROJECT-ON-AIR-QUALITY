# STATISTICS-PROJECT-ON-AIR-QUALITY
Explore Mexico City's air quality with statistics program in R. Analyze pollution's impact on PM10 concentration in a comprehensive study

## Overview

Welcome to the "Statistics Project on Air Quality." This project aims to analyze air quality data in Mexico City, with a specific focus on understanding the factors influencing the concentration of suspended particulate matter with a diameter of less than 10 micrometers (PM10). Air quality is a critical issue that affects the health and well-being of individuals in large cities, and it's vital to address and measure this problem accurately.

## Research Question

The central research question of this project is:

**"What is the impact of air pollution levels on the concentration of PM10 in the Mexico City metropolitan area?"**

We aim to answer this question by performing statistical analyses on air quality data, with a particular focus on the following variables:
- Concentration of PM10 (Dependent Variable)
- Monóxido de Carbono (CO)
- Óxidos de Nitrógeno (NOx)
- Ozono (O3)
- Dióxido de Nitrógeno (NO2)

## Project Contents

1. **Introduction**: Discusses the significance of the project and its context, emphasizing the importance of addressing air quality issues in Mexico City.

2. **Research Question and Variables**: Describes the research question and the variables associated with the analysis. This section includes a detailed explanation of the dependent and independent variables.

3. **Multiple Linear Regression Model**: Presents the multiple linear regression model developed by the project team. It includes the R code for data analysis, interpretation of the model's results, and assessments of model fit and significance.

4. **New Model Proposed Individually**: Introduces a linear regression model proposed individually. It provides the R code, interpretation of results, and assessments of model fit and significance.

5. **Comparison of Models**: Compares the multiple linear regression model with the individually proposed linear regression model based on factors such as model fit, significance of coefficients, and evaluation of residuals.

6. **Conclusion**: Summarizes the findings of the project and offers insights into which model is more effective for the analysis of air quality data.
